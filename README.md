## WeBot: A Webull Trading Bot
This project is a work in progress. I myself am a programmer, jet mechanic, and market trader, in both long and short positions, and I find myself not able to keep up with the market while I work. After doing my own research, I have found only one Webull API by Ted Chou which has been integrated into this project. You can find his on-going project [here](https://github.com/tedchou12/webull).

Since the API is only a connection to the Webull Trading Market, the bot performs many functions that a person would do which includes buying, selling, stop loss, limit orders etc. It uses the API as a connection line to perform any functions needed. Currently, the bot can only perform manual functions, but the goal is to have automated functions performed based on the users watch list. Eventually, this will be done asynchronously while the user can perform other functions, or even update their watch list.
